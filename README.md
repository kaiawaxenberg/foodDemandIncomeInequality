Project: Modelling Inequality in the Future Food System using PLUMv2

Overview: This repository contains all the necessary files and scripts for data analysis, data preparation, and figure generation related to the manuscript "Improving global food demand projections with income inequality."

This work utilises the PLUMv2 model, for which data and scripts are hosted on gitlabs. Results files which are too large to store on GitHub are hosted on the University of Edinburgh supercomputer cluster, EDDIE. 

To run the scripts in this repository, you will need to have the following software and packages installed:

R (version 4.0 or higher)
RStudio (optional, for easier interaction with R scripts and notebooks)
Required R packages:
dplyr
ggplot2
data.table
